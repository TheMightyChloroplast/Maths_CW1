Mathematics and Graphics for computer games 1- Coursework 1, implement and L system.


This courwork contains the implementation of the 8 required L systems for this coursework.
Everything is done within one script named Lsystems.

To manually move forwards and backwards with the iterations, you need to press A to go backwards and D to go forwards. There is a limit of seven iterations to try and avoid the system from crashing.

To change between the different L systems press the number keys 1-8. Each of them is mapped to one L system.
